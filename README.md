# Getting Started

## Project Infos
This is my first PHP MVC framework and I think it contains a lot of bugs. It's easy to use and has been used as study case for my degree.
Feel free to use it, and I know it doesn't have documentation. I would like to add it as soon as possible. 

## What is Eagle MVC
Eagle MVC is a free MVC PHP framework allowing you to create web based PHP applications in an easy way. 
Eagle works with apache http server, and uses the .htaccess file to get all the URI requests trough the browser
